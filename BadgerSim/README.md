# Badger Sim

You are to complete a C++ application to simulate the interaction of Badger entities with their environment as detailed below. The application must be written using the given framework available via Blackboard. You should:

* Modify the MyPhysicsSystem and/or ToyDrone classes so that the drones move in response to the forces applied to their physics representations (they should be projected up into the air with a spiral motion) and are affected by gravity, drag and a wind vector.
* Modify the ToyDrone class so that the drones provide a fire / smoke trail when in motion.
* Modify the MyPhysicsSystem, and/or ToyDrone classes so that the Badger pushes the drones when it collides with them.
* Refactor your code to the highest quality you can.
* Document (in block code comments) which simulation techniques are being used, how, and explain the choices made to satisfy and implement the above requirements.
